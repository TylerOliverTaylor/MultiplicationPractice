# MultiplicationPractice
 This is a game written to simulate my daughters multiplication tests.  The game originally included a screaming sound when you answered a question incorrectly.....wife made me take it out. 

Rules:
- Start at "0"
- Get a question correct and get a point.
- Get a question wrong and lose a point.
- Get to "20" and you win.
- Get to "-5" and you lose.
